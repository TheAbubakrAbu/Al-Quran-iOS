// A machine comparison of the twenty riwayaat against Hafs an Asim, reached from the bottom of the
// Qiraat guide.
//
// WHY IT IS BURIED. Everything else in the Qiraat guide is the settled biographical and historical
// record. This page is not: it is the output of a program that read the printed mushafs and diffed
// them, and while the method is sound the numbers carry the extraction's own errors. A reader who
// stumbles onto a table of "how much each riwayah differs" without that context can badly misread
// it, so the page sits behind a deliberate gesture and opens with the caveat rather than the data.
//
// SOURCING. The figures are this app's own measurements, described in "How these numbers were
// produced" below. The framing around them (why the counting traditions differ, what a printed
// mushaf can and cannot record) follows the standard works named in the further-reading section.
