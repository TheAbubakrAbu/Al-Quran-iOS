/// Two-way settings sync between iPhone and Apple Watch.
///
/// Designed to avoid the failure modes the previous version had:
/// - **Never transmits a default.** A snapshot carries *only* settings this device has actually set, and the
///   receiver only writes keys that are present. So a payload can never reset an unmentioned (or freshly
///   installed) setting to its default - the cause of settings randomly flipping on/off or "all resetting."
/// - **Wall-clock recency + device tiebreak.** Each payload carries the real timestamp of the write plus
///   the originating device's rank (iPhone outranks the watch). A device applies an incoming payload only
///   if it is *newer* than everything it has already sent or applied - strictly later in time, or, only
///   when two writes share the exact same instant, made by the higher-ranked device. So the literally
///   newest edit always wins and iPhone wins ties, instead of a logical counter letting a stale-but-busier
///   device clobber a newer one (which looked like settings randomly "resetting").
/// - **Echo suppression.** After applying a remote snapshot we remember its serialized form, so the local
///   change it triggers doesn't get sent straight back.
/// - **Reliable channel.** Uses `updateApplicationContext` (always delivered, latest-state-wins) plus an
///   immediate `sendMessage` when reachable; duplicates are harmless because of the recency check.
///
/// All sync bookkeeping is read and mutated only on the main queue, so the WCSession delegate callbacks
/// (which arrive on a background queue) and the debounced sender never race.
