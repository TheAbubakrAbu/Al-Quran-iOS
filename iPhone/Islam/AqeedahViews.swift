                    Text("**Mu‘tazilah (المُعتَزِلَة)**: from **ع-ز-ل**, i‘tazala, “to withdraw” or “to set oneself apart.” Wasil ibn Ata (80–131 AH) sat in the circle of al-Hasan al-Basri (d. 110 AH) in Basrah. When a man asked about the Muslim who commits a major sin, Wasil answered ahead of his teacher that he is neither a believer nor a disbeliever but in “a station between the two stations,” and withdrew to a pillar of the mosque with those who agreed with him; al-Hasan said, “Wasil has withdrawn from us (i‘tazalana Wasil)” (ash-Shahrastani, al-Milal wan-Nihal). His companion Amr ibn Ubayd (d. 144 AH) joined him, and the name stuck. They built their creed on five principles (al-usul al-khamsah): **tawhid**, by which they meant denying Allah’s attributes; **‘adl**, “justice,” by which they meant that Allah does not create the servants’ acts; **al-wa‘d wal-wa‘id**, the promise and the threat, by which they meant that the major sinner is in the Fire forever; **al-manzilah bayn al-manzilatayn**, the station between two stations; and **enjoining good and forbidding evil**, by which they justified revolt against the rulers. They called themselves “the people of tawhid and justice”; Ahl as-Sunnah called them the Mu‘tazilah and, for their denial of the decree, the Qadariyyah (al-Ash‘ari, Maqalat al-Islamiyyin; ash-Shahrastani, al-Milal wan-Nihal).")

He was a Mu‘tazili for about forty years under his stepfather al-Jubba’i, renounced them publicly in the mosque of Basrah, and ended by writing al-Ibanah on the creed of Imam Ahmad, as quoted above (Ibn Asakir, Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari). The school that bears his name follows his middle period rather than his last book: it affirms seven attributes (life, knowledge, power, will, hearing, sight, and speech) by rational proof, reinterprets (**ta’wil**) the rest, such as the Hand, the Face, and the rising over the Throne, and proves the existence of Allah by the kalam argument from the origination of bodies rather than by the way of the Quran.")

They deferred deeds out of faith: faith, they said, is affirmation only, so sins do not diminish it and the sinner is a believer of complete faith; the extreme form, Jahm’s, makes faith bare knowledge in the heart.
