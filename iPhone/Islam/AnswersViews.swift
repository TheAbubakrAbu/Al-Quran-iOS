The blessing of Musa says the Lord “came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran“ (Deuteronomy 33:2): Sinai is the revelation to Musa, Seir the land of Isa, and Paran the wilderness where Isma‘il settled (Genesis 21:21), that is, the Hijaz. Isaiah 42 foretells a servant who brings law to the nations and calls on Kedar, the son of Isma‘il (Genesis 25:13), to sing a new song. Ibn al-Qayyim gathered these in Hidayat al-Hayara, and Ibn Taymiyyah in al-Jawab as-Sahih.")

The Torah itself supports it: Genesis 22:2 calls the son to be sacrificed “thine only son,“ and Isma‘il was born some fourteen years before Ishaq (Genesis 16:16, 21:5), so for those years he alone was the only son.
