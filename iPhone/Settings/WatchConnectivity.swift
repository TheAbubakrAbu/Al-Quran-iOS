/// Two-way settings sync between iPhone and Apple Watch.
///
/// The protocol is a **per-key last-writer-wins merge** (an LWW map). Every synced setting travels with
/// its own `(timestamp, deviceRank)` stamp, and a device applies an incoming key only when that key's
/// stamp is newer than the one it already holds (strictly later wall-clock time; the higher-ranked
/// device — iPhone — wins only an exact-same-instant tie).
///
/// Why per-key and not whole-snapshot: the previous protocol stamped the *entire* snapshot with one
/// timestamp per send. Any send from a device holding one stale value re-asserted that stale value as
/// "just written," so a watch that hadn't yet received a phone edit could revert it merely by syncing an
/// unrelated change — the "Hanafi calculation keeps reverting" bug — and the phone's still-queued edit
/// then looked old to the watch and was rejected, which presented as sync being broken entirely. With
/// per-key stamps a device only fresh-stamps keys whose value it actually changed, so a stale peer loses
/// exactly the keys it is stale on and nothing else.
///
/// Other invariants, kept from (or hardened over) the previous design:
/// - **Never transmits a default.** A payload carries only settings this device actually holds (see
///   `Settings.watchSyncSnapshot()`), and the receiver only writes keys that are present, so a freshly
///   installed device cannot reset its peer.
/// - **Bookkeeping commits only after the apply.** Stamps and echo-guard state for received keys are
///   persisted in the same main-actor pass that applies them, so a suspension can never leave a device
///   believing it holds a value it never wrote (and then re-broadcasting its stale one).
/// - **Echo suppression by convergence.** `lastPushedFields` records what the reliable channel already
///   holds; after applying a peer's keys we mark them pushed, so the local didSets an apply fires never
///   echo identical state back. Each side compares only against its *own* payload form, so structural
///   asymmetries (the watch never sends `travelingMode`) can't cause endless re-send ping-pong.
/// - **Reliable channel.** `updateApplicationContext` (always delivered, latest-state-wins — safe here
///   because every payload carries the full field map) plus an immediate `sendMessage` fast path when
///   reachable; duplicates are harmless because of the per-key recency check.
/// - **Clock-skew fencing.** A field stamped absurdly far in our future (mis-set peer clock) is skipped,
///   and local stamps are derived from `max(now, held stamp.nextUp)` with a clamped seed, so timestamps
///   can never run away into the future and freeze out legitimate edits.
/// - **Legacy interop.** A payload from a peer still on the whole-snapshot build (its single timestamp
///   applied to every key) merges through the same per-key gate, seeded from the old protocol's persisted
///   recency watermark — so a stale legacy peer is rejected exactly as it was before. Outgoing payloads
///   still mirror the legacy fields so an un-updated peer keeps receiving.
///
/// All sync bookkeeping is read and mutated only on the main thread (main queue hops + `@MainActor`
/// tasks), so the WCSession delegate callbacks (background queue) and the debounced sender never race.
