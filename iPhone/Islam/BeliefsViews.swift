When they agreed on a ruling it was called “the opinion of the Abadilah.” Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) died earlier and, as Imam Ahmad noted (reported by Ibn as-Salah in his Muqaddimah), is not counted among them, but he is the root of the fiqh of Kufa: his students Alqamah and al-Aswad taught Ibrahim an-Nakha‘i, who taught Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman, the teacher of Abu Hanifah. Ibn Abbas’s circle in Makkah (Ata’, Mujahid, Tawus, and Ikrimah) and Ibn Umar’s student Nafi‘, from whom Malik narrated, show that every madhhab goes back through the Tabi‘in to the Companions, and through them to the Prophet (peace be upon him).")
