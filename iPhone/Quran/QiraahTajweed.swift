/// Tajweed / khilaf coloring for the 19 non-Hafs riwayat. Two generations:
///  * v2 (the 7 non-beta KFGQPC riwayat): rules and EXACT letter extents are
///    derived from the original texts' own marks at build time - the imalah
///    dot (U+065C), taqlil ring (U+06EA), silah waw (U+06E5), the idgham
///    bare-letter + shadda orthography, Warsh's naql/badal/raa/lam patterns -
///    cross-checked against the Islamweb prints (Scripts note in repo).
///    Khilaf word flags still come from the print extraction; their letter
///    extents are refined by diffing the word against its aligned Hafs token.
///  * v1 (the 12 beta riwayat): word flags + ink extents extracted from the
///    Islamweb printed mushaf PDFs, letters resolved at paint time.
/// Each riwayah pack carries:
///  * word-level rule colors (`rules`): what differs from Hafs, idgham,
///    imalah/taqlil, sakt, ... The MEANING of a color is per edition and
///    ships in `legend`, transcribed from that mushaf's own printed legend box.
///  * the riwayah's own ayah -> page table (`pages`): the true pagination of
///    ITS 604-page print. The Madinah page numbers on the Hafs rows do not
///    hold for other riwayat (merged ayahs, different orthography), which is
///    why page mode used to break on them.
///
/// Same storage/loading pattern as `BetaQiraatStore`: one raw-deflate JSON
/// per riwayah, lazily loaded, thread-safe by lock (rendering reads on main,
/// pagination reads from a detached build).
