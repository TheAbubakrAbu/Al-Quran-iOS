The Companions did not do it after his death, the scholars differed over it, and Ibn Taymiyyah in Qa‘idah Jalilah and al-Albani in at-Tawassul held it to be an innovation rather than shirk in itself, while warning that it is the door through which shirk enters.

Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said as he lay wounded: “There is no share in Islam for one who leaves the prayer” (reported by Malik in al-Muwatta). On this basis Imam Ahmad held that whoever abandons the prayer entirely, even while admitting it is obligatory, commits major kufr, and Ibn Baz and Ibn al-Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them) held the same. Abu Hanifah, Malik, and ash-Shafi‘i held that he is a grave sinner who has not left Islam unless he denies that it is obligatory, understanding the kufr in these texts as minor kufr, and al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) chose this view.

And even on the stronger view no one applies that ruling to a particular man he knows: that belongs to the scholars and the judge, as above.

Ahl as-Sunnah answer with respect for both men and with the proofs. There is no good innovation in worship, by the Prophet’s own words and by Ibn Umar’s. The three best generations, who had every reason to do it, did not. Imam Malik’s words quoted on the Bid‘ah page apply exactly: what was not religion on the day the religion was completed is not religion today. The analogy with Ashura fails, because the Ashura fast is itself an act the Prophet legislated, while gratitude for his birth was expressed by him in the Monday fast, and we cannot legislate a second expression he did not.

They claimed descent from Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), but the scholars of lineage denied it; in 402 AH the leading scholars and genealogists in Baghdad, including the Alawi sharifs ar-Radi and al-Murtada, signed a written declaration that the claim was false, as Ibn Kathir records in al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah under the events of that year. So the yearly birthday celebration began neither among the Companions nor among the imams, but in a state whose rulers made festivals of their own, the caliph’s own birthday among them.")

The scholar Ibn Dihyah composed a book for him on the Prophet’s birth, at-Tanwir fi Mawlid as-Siraj al-Munir, and was rewarded with a thousand dinars, as Ibn Khallikan records. So the celebration entered the Sunni world in the seventh century, by the choice of a king, six hundred years after the Prophet (peace be upon him).")
